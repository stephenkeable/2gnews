<h1>About</h1>

<p>2G News is built around the idea that if you build a website that runs fast on a 2G mobile phone, it will feel instant on all other devices and platforms.</p>

<h2>Technical info</h2>

<p>Built using a Node.js and Express JS back end, hosted on Heroku, with CDN via Amazon Cloudfront.</p>

<p>From the ground up we build for speed, meaning that HTML, CSS and JS is minified then served with GZIP compression via our CDN.</p>

<p>We also avoid using code when we don't have to, so minimal CSS classes. No loading of external JS analytics tools or adverts, if we do add either we will choose a platform that is fast with a great privacy policy.</p>

<p>2G News was created by front-end developer <a href="http://www.stephenkeable.co.uk" target="_blank">Stephen Keable</a>.</p>
